# Godot AnimationTree Test

An AnimationTree test for Godot 4.1 using the free version of [KayKit - Character Pack : Adventurers](https://kaylousberg.itch.io/kaykit-adventurers)


3D animations is something I've been struggling with for a while.

Blending walk/run animations with attack animations, for example, is something I know the theory of but have never been able to implement in Godot until now.

I've been using the [Godot AnimationTree tutorial](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/animation/animation_tree.html) as a guide.
